# RadioHead Arduino Library + extras.
In order to play with my Adafruit feather I needed to easily turn on and off different features of the RH RF69 chip. This repo is where I have made those changes.

## Changes made so far
1. Ability to set the encoding type on the fly.

## Installation
Install this using the following instructions:
```bash
cd <your Arduino/libraries/ directory>
git clone https://github.com/geekskick/RadioHead-Extras.git
mv RadioHead-Extras RadioHead
```

## Usage
Use this as you would normally, apart from you can now enjoy some fantastic extra (manually tested!) features!
